AsWing is an Open Source Flash ActionScript GUI framework and library that allows programmers to make their flash application(or RIA) UI easily. Its usage is similar to Java Swing. It provides a set of GUI components, which we intent to implement in pure object oriented ActionScript 2. A pluggable look and feel will be implemented too. It also provides many Util classes.

AsWing A3 is the next/another life with ActionScript 3, components set is almost same to ActionScript 2 time, but capabilities are much more powerful.
